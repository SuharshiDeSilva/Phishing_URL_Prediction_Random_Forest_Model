# Phishing_URL_Prediction_Random_Forest_Model

Phishing attacks represent a significant aspect of cybersecurity attacks involves in deceiving users into revealing sensitive information by posing as legitimate entities through fraudulent platforms. They have grown in sophistication and frequency, targeting individuals and organisations and resulting in significant financial and data losses. This research project aims to contribute to the fight against such attacks by developing a robust ML model for detecting phishing Websites.

## Project Objective

- To find a suitable balanced dataset to create reliable ML model.
- To implement a comprehensive data preparation process with feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and data cleaning to enhance the model performance.
- To identify and build a predictive model using ML techniques for detecting phishing URLs.

## Business Case

To create a model that accurately predicts phishing URL.

## Goal
To accurately predict phishing URL without falsely predicting phishing URLs which could affect the users. 

## Deliverables
